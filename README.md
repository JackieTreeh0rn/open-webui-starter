## ðŸ‘·Project Overview

The Open WebUI Starter project is an entry point into using the open-source project Open WebUI. The goal is to simplify setup and configuration. Open WebUI 
integrates with various Large Language Models (LLMs) and provides a private, user-friendly, and local interface for interacting with computer intelligence.

Here is a link to follow ðŸ”—[project development](https://github.com/users/iamobservable/projects/1).

## Installation

To install the Open WebUI Starter project, follow these steps:


### Install Docker

Get started by visiting the [get-started section](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) of the Docker website. The website will describe how to download and install Docker Desktop.


### Clone this repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/iamobservable/open-webui-starter.git
```

### Create the docker compose and environment files

```sh
cp compose.yml.example compose.yml

cp conf/mcposerver/config.example conf/mcposerver/config.json
cp conf/nginx/nginx.example conf/nginx/nginx.conf
cp conf/nginx/conf.d/default.example conf/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

cp env/auth.example env/auth.env
cp env/db.example env/db.env
cp env/docling.example env/docling.env
cp env/edgetts.example env/edgetts.env
cp env/ollama.example env/ollama.env
cp env/mcposerver.example env/mcposerver.env
cp env/nginx.example env/nginx.env
cp env/openwebui.example env/openwebui.env
cp env/redis.example env/redis.env
cp env/searxng.example env/searxng.env
cp env/tika.example env/tika.env
cp env/watchtower.example env/watchtower.env
```

*The environment files can contain sensitive information such as API keys 
and passwords. Do not check them into source control. *.env files have been
added to the project .gitignore for this reason.*

### Allow Open WebUI to manage authentication across Open WebUI, Redis, and Searxng.

Open WebUI uses Java Web Token (JWT) to manage authentication. To configure this, a secret key will need to be set in 3 environment files; the keys SEARXNG_SECRET, JWT_SECRET, and WEB_SECRET_KEY. Update the following files accordingly.

- *SEARXNG_SECRET* - [env/searxng.env](http://github.com/iamobservable/open-webui-starter/blob/main/env/searxng.example#L2)
- *JWT_SECRET* - [env/auth.env](http://github.com/iamobservable/open-webui-starter/blob/main/env/auth.example#L2)
- *WEBUI_SECRET_KEY* - [env/openwebui.env](http://github.com/iamobservable/open-webui-starter/blob/main/env/openwebui.example#L35)

**Make sure the environment files match**:. This allows jwt token authentication to work with the main Open WebUI (/), swagger (/docs), redis (/redis), and searxng (/searxng)


### Start docker container environment from a terminal

The applciation is ready to start. Let's do it!

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

### Download the Ollama models from a terminal

The initial up command above will automatically download two models.

1. nomic-embed-text:latest (used for RAG embeddings)
2. qwen3:0.6b (small model for testing purposes)

Now download another LLM for Ollama. Qwen3:4b is listed below, but feel free to change this to any model that works best. [More on Ollama models](https://ollama.com/search)

```sh
docker compose exec ollama bash

ollama pull qwen3:4b
```

Once the containers are started, and any models are downloaded, the Open WebUI platform is ready to be accessed. Visit 
[http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) in a web browser.



## Additional Setup

### MCP Servers

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a configurable set of tools, resources, prompts, samplings, and roots. They provide 
a structured way to expose local functionality to the LLM. Examples are providing access to the local file system, 
searching the internet, interacting with git or github, and much more.

#### Manual entry (MUST COMPLETE)

The configuration for tools currently requires a manual step to complete. This is due my own lack of understanding of how 
the environment variable TOOL_SERVER_CONNECTIONS is used in [env/openwebui.env](http://github.com/iamobservable/open-webui-starter/blob/main/env/openwebui.example#L34). 
If anyone has a good understanding, and has been able to see it work in practice, please share a [pull request](https://github.com/iamobservable/open-webui-starter/pulls) or 
message me [directly on Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/observable).

For now, to use the two default tools, it is required to add them manually. **They will NOT** automatically load using the environment variable TOOL_SERVER_CONNECTIONS, enen 
though it is added. Add the following two urls using the Settings -> Tools -> General interface. This can also be set in the Admin Settings as well.

*Note - the default postgres tool is configured to access this Open WebUI postgres database. While this is read-only, the tool server that is defined allows any user with 
the credentials added to the [env/mcposerver.env](http://github.com/iamobservable/open-webui-starter/blob/main/conf/mcposerver/config.example#L12) to access the database tables. If 
anything should be restricted, make sure to do so ahead of time.*

#### Initial configuration

Configurations for MCP services can be found in the [conf/mcposerver/config.json](https://github.com/iamobservable/open-webui-starter/blob/main/conf/mcposerver/config.example) file. Links below in the table describe the initially configuration.

***Note - the time tool is configured using uvx instead of directly with the python binary, as the repository describes*** 

A few tool examples are listed below.

| Tool                                                                               | Description                                                               | Configuration |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| [time](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/time)         | Provides current time values for [configured timezone](https://github.com/iamobservable/open-webui-starter/blob/main/conf/mcposerver/config.example#L5)                      | [config/mcposerver/config.json](https://github.com/iamobservable/open-webui-starter/blob/main/conf/mcposerver/config.example#L3) |
| [postgres](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/postgres) | Provides sql querying for the configured database (defaults to openwebui) | [config/mcposerver/config.json](https://github.com/iamobservable/open-webui-starter/blob/main/conf/mcposerver/config.example#L7) |

#### MCP Server Discovery

The following three MCP Server sources are a great place to look for tools to add.

- [Model Context Protocol servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers?tab=readme-ov-file#model-context-protocol-servers)
- [Awesome MCP Servers](https://mcpservers.org/)
- [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/)

### Watchtower and Notifications

A Watchtower container provides a convenient way to check in on all container
versions to see if updates have been released. Once updates are found, Watchtower 
will pull the latest container image(s), stop the currently running container and 
start a new container based on the new image. **And it is all automatic, look no hands!**

After completing its process, 
Watchtower can send notifications. More can be found on notifications via 
the [Watchtower website](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/notifications/).

For the sake of simplicity, this document will cover the instructions for setting 
up notifications via Discord. The Watchtower [arguments section](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/arguments/) describes 
additional settings available for the watchtower setup.

1. Edit and uncomment [env/watchtower.env](https://github.com/iamobservable/open-webui-starter/blob/main/env/watchtower.example#L2) with a discord link. [More information](https://containrrr.dev/shoutrrr/v0.8/services/discord/) is provided on how to create a discord link (token@webhookid).
2. Restart the watchtower container

```bash
docker compose down watchtower && docker compose up watchtower -d
```

### Migrating from Sqlite to Postgresql

**Please note, the starter project does not use Sqlite for storage. Postgresql has been configured by default.**

For installations where the 
environment was already setup to use Sqlite, please refer to 
[Taylor Wilsdon](https://github.com/taylorwilsdon)'s github repository 
[open-webui-postgres-migration](https://github.com/taylorwilsdon/open-webui-postgres-migration). 
In it, he provides a migration tool for converting between the two databases.


## Service Examples

This section is to show how services within docker compose infra can be used 
directly or programmatically without the Open WebUI interface. The examples 
have been created as *.sh scripts that can be executed via the command line.


### Docling

**PDF document to markdown**

Generates a JSON document with the markdown text included. Changes to the config.json document, located in the same directory, can change how Docling responds. More information on how to configure Docling can be found in the [Advance usage section](https://github.com/docling-project/docling-serve/blob/main/docs/usage.md) of the [Docling Serve documentation](https://github.com/docling-project/docling-serve/blob/main/docs/README.md).

```sh
curl -X POST "http://localhost:4000/docling/v1alpha/convert/source" \
    -H "accept: application/json" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{

### Edgetts

EdgeTTS is a service integration that uses Microsoft's online text-to-speech 
service. Keep in mind, if this is NOT completely local, as it requires a
connection to Microsoft's service.
